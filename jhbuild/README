This scripts allow you to set a JHBuild environment to develop with
Mesa as quick as possible.

To do so, create a JHBUILD_CONFIG file and write a content like this:

    $ cat JHBUILD_CONFIG
    JHBUILD_MESA_ROOT=/opt/mesa
    MESA_RESOURCES=""

That will mean that you want to use `/opt/mesa` as your base working
directory and that this repository resides at
`/opt/mesa/mesa-resources.git` (change to another absolute paths if you
have it somewher else).

Once this is done, for building an environment intended for the
**i965** mesa driver, you only have to **move to this directory** and
run:

    $ ./jhbuild-compile.sh i965
    ...

Once finished, you will have your environment set.

Now, if you want to work inside the environment you will only have to run:

    $ ./jhbuild.sh i965 shell
    [JHBUILD}$

This script works as a wrapper for the JHBuild so you can pass any
argument JHBuild would accept.

Additionally, you can set working environments for *i965*, *nouveau*,
*radeon* and the proprietary *NVidia* and *AMD* drivers.
