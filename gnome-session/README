The files in this directory will help you to set an alternative
JHBuild GNOME session for the GDM session chooser.

The intention is to be able to run GNOME with the mesa drivers you
choose.

For that, you only have to set a JHBuild environment as described in
the *jhbuild* directory, copy the `jhbuild-mesa-gnome.desktop` file to
`/usr/share/xsessions` and the `jhbuild-mesa-gnome.session` file to
`/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions`.

Then, modify `jhbuild-mesa-gnome.desktop` to set the proper path for
the `jhbuild-mesa-gnome-session` executable and also modify this one
to point to the proper paths for the JHBuild environment to use.
