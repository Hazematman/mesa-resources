PNG WORKAROUNDS
===============
In order to compile deqp you need png, and right now it is wrongly
configured, so this directory includes two workarounds:

  * 0001-Sets-correct-libpng-header-for-CMake.patch: this is the patch
    that solves the issue, included on the already opened bug [1], but
    not on master yet.

  * deqp-local-cmake.sh: set by hand where the png libray is when
    calling cmake.

You can use or the other.

SCRIPTS
=======

   * run-n-times-flaky-deqp-case.sh: run a deqp test n times, and
     returns how many runs have passed. Useful for flaky tests.

   * deqp-list: it includes small script to analyze direcly qpa
     files. vk-gl-cts provides their own scripts but they can be slow:
