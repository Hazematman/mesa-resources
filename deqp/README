In order to compile deqp you need png, and right now it is wrongly
configured, so this directory includes two workarounds:

  * 0001-Sets-correct-libpng-header-for-CMake.patch: this is the patch
    that solves the issue, included on the already opened bug [1], but
    not on master yet.

  * deqp-local-cmake.sh: set by hand where the png libray is when
    calling cmake.

You can use or the other.
